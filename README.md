### This Library allows you to use a terminal window from C++ in Java.
You can:
- set the cursor position
- fill the console with one type of character or only a part (like fillRect)
- print chars, ints, strings
- set the background and foreground color to one of 16 different colors
- get keyboard input
- change the font size to 3 different sizes
- change the title
- hide the cursor

This library doesn't contain a lot of code but it is really helpful (and looks nice). Its good for console-based games and also for debugging. I created this lib because I wasn't able to open a cmd window within Java except when I run my program with "java -jar" in an already open cmd window. So I created this.

I created this on Windows and it also works for Windows. I don't know if it will run on MacOS or Linux.

This console library will be updated when I need something to add or change or when I think something is missing.
